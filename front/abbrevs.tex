% Use this file to create "glossary entries" for abbreviations and acronyms,
% and other notation. The entries defined here don't necessarily have to be 
% used in the thesis (but then you have to decide whether or not to display
% the unused entries).

% For this file to compile (and the example text in the main/prelims.tex file),
% the package glossaries-extra is required. It is automatically included unless
% the noabbrevs class option is used.

% The following will alter the style for typesetting abbreviations when using 
% the \gls command. Note you can also use multiple styles by categorizing 
% abbreviations; see the documentation for the glossaries-extras package at:
% https://ctan.org/pkg/glossaries-extra
