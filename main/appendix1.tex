\chapter{Some sort of an appendix}
\label{appendix:somesort}

You may want to include appendices of your own volition. Also, if you've developed any computer software, that needs to go in as an appendix as well.

\section{A first section in this appendix}

Some appendix content here. And something nice to finish things off:

    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{graphics/mygraphic2-for-ps.eps}
  \fi
  \caption{A Flower.}
\end{figure}

\section{Another appendix section}
After the (last) appendix-section comes the thesis' bibliography; Its style is set with the \verb|\thesisbibstyle| command. Then there are the Hebrew parts of thesis, which don't exactly ``follow" the bibliography in a logical sense, but rather start at the beginning of the thesis when considered as a right-to-left printed booklet. Thus, the last page of the extended Hebrew abstract of the thesis comes right ``after" the last page of the bibliography if you're turning the pages in left-to-right order.
