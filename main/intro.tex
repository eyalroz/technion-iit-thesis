Here you can introduce the field, survey past results, give context, use citations of course... (e.g. \cite{CLR}). It is probably worthwhile to clarify the goals or targets of the research and describe the process, unless this is done later.

You can also introduce \emph{a key concept} (or rather, several) without formally defining them until later on.

\subsection*{An unnumbered subsection}

You may want to break up the intro into parts with titles. Subsectioning without numbering is an option you might want to consider.

Some people include a specific section overviewing the results ("In Chapter so-and-so, we will see how etc.") which is also a way of describing the structure of the thesis. But this is not necessary.

\subsection*{Thesis options and appearance}

Please note that the \texttt{iitthesis} class has several options when you use it, such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{fullpageDraft} to avoid the margins necessary for proper binding when you make the final print
\item \texttt{beforeDefense} makes the personal acknowledgements invisible; use this to print the copies you submit initially to the grad school for sending to the opponent panel, i.e. thesis readers (who shouldn't see those parts). For the final submission, after having successfully defended --- drop this option. 
\item \texttt{noabbrevs} no notation \& abbreviations list will be included in the thesis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hebrew font}

The \texttt{iitthesis} document class uses the David CLM font family for Hebrew text. CLM is a shorthand for ``Culmus'' (\texthebrew{קולמוס}) --- the name of a freely-available Hebrew font package. It may be bundled with your LaTeX distribution, or otherwise, must be available as system fonts. If you're missing the Culmus fonts, try adding an appropriate package from your LaTeX distribution or system distribution; alternatively, you might want to visit the Culmus project page at \url{http://culmus.sourceforge.net/} and download and install the fonts manually.

\subsection*{Setting thesis meta-data and publication information}

The document class used to generate this document defines several commands you can use to set information  regarding your thesis, which is used in the title pages and elsewhere in the front matter.  Every (or almost every) command has an English and a Hebrew variant, with a \texttt{English} or \texttt{Hebrew} suffix to the command name. Examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|\titleHebrew|, \verb|\titleEnglish|
\item \verb|\authorHebrew|, \verb|\authorEnglish|
\item \verb|\JewishDateHebrew|, \verb|\JewishDateEnglish|
\item \verb|\GregorianDateHebrew|, \verb|\GregorianDateEnglish|
\item \verb|\publicationinfoHebrew|, \verb|\publicationinfoEnglish|
\end{itemize}

The file \texttt{misc/thesis-fields.tex} contains invocations of several such commands (some of them commented-out with \texttt{\%}), and some additional information about them.
