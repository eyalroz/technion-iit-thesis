% You may wish to use some of the following options of the iitthesis
% package:
%
% fullpageDraft      avoid the margins necessary for proper binding and
%   just view or print a draft.
% beforeDefense      makes the personal acknowledgements invisible;
%   use this to print the copies you submit initially to the grad school
%   for sending to the opponent panel, i.e. thesis readers (who shouldn't
%   see those parts). For the final submission, after having successfully
%   defended - drop this option.
% noabbrevs          no notation & abbreviations list will be included
%   in the thesis.
%
% Additionally, you must specify the degree for which you're writing
% your thesis (MSc/PhD/MArch etc.)
%
\documentclass[PhD]{misc/iitthesis}


% Definitions of info fields for the thesis - subject, advisor,
% faculty, acknowledgements, etc. etc. The thesis-fields file 
% contains Hebrew text, and should use the UTF-8 character set
% encoding (not iso-8859-8-i or windows codepage 1255).
\include{misc/thesis-fields}

% Personal acknowledgements (are only used for the post-exam
% version)
\include{front/personal-acks}

% A separate file for the abstract - in English and in Hebrew, so
% you must make sure it's also in the UTF-8 character set encoding.

% Uncomment this if you want to have a list of abbreviations and acronyms

% necessary and not everyone might like it)

% Front Matter
% ------------

% The following command will typeset the outer cover page, the
% inner title page, the acknowledgements page, etc. - everything
% up to but not including the introduction
\makefrontmatter

% Main Matter
% ------------
%
% To conform to Technion regulations, the main matter should begin
% with an introduction (including a survey of relevant past work):
%
\include{main/intro}

%
% and then cover:
% - The methods used in the research
% - The research results
% - Discussion and conclusions from the results
%
% but not necessarily with a specific chapter for each of them.
%
% Then you have your main chapters (although these might still
% include an initial chapter on technical preliminaries, experimental
% system setup, and/or a final chapter with summary, discussion and further
% research direction or questions)

\include{main/prelims}
\include{main/mainchap1}
\include{main/conclusion}
%
% Add any appendices here; they must come _before_ the bibliography
%
\appendix
%\noappendicestocpagenum
%\addappheadtotoc
\include{main/appendix1}

% Back Matter
% ------------

% The following command will typeset the bibliography,
% then typeset the Hebrew part of the thesis:
% - Cover page
% - Title page
% - Acknowledgements page
%  (NO table of contents or list of figures in Hebrew)
% - (Extended) abstract (1000-2000 words)
%
% based on information you've provided in the thesis-fields file
% (including the relative paths to your bib files). The Hebrew
% content will be typeset in _reverse_page_order_, i.e. first
% in the file will be the last page of the abstract, and the
% Hebrew cover page will be the last page of the file.
%
\makebackmatter

% The resulting PDF can be printed and taken straight to binding,
% i.e. you do not need to flip any pages anywhere. Of course,
% mind the LaTeX error and warning messages, overfull hboxes etc.
